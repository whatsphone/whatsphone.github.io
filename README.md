# Whatsphone

Simple HTML app to open a phone number in WhatsApp without having to save it to contacts first.

The app can be accessed for free here: [whatsphone.github.io](https://whatsphone.github.io/)

As a shortcut, you can also:
- Append **#** to the URL and your number (country indicator optional if your IP address is in the same country) to pre-populate it, for example:  
[whatsphone.github.io#+15551234567](https://whatsphone.github.io/#+15551234567)
- Append **##** to the URL and your number to open it in WhatsApp right away, for example:  
[whatsphone.github.io##+15551234567](https://whatsphone.github.io/##+15551234567)
